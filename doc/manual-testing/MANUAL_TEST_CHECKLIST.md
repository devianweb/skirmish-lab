# Manual Test Checklist (consolidated)

One living checklist for things automated tests can't prove: feel, visuals, and two-player flows. It replaces the older per-phase checklists (Phase 13 map builder, Phase 13.5 playtest, terrain structure, elevation), which were audited against the current rules and folded in here. Verified items are removed once the owner ticks them (last passes: 2026-11-02, batch 1A the same evening, batches 1B/1E, 1F, 1H and 1G on 2026-11-03/04, the 1C/1D pass on 2026-11-04, the batch 1I pass on 2026-11-05, the 13.6E pass (area terrain, Standard Battlefield) and the rush-past-rubble / activation hazard / squad charge ring retests on 2026-11-09, the 14A concede/results pass the same day, the 14B rematch pass on 2026-11-10, and the 14C-2 passes the same day (jumps and group crossing, push, keep-away in 3D, flying indicator, squad follow-through, dangerous terrain dice), the 14C-2 PR 7/7B special rules pass on 2026-11-11 (Fast/Slow, Impact, Counter, Assault, Shred, dangerous terrain wording, activation casualty pick), and the 14C-2 PR 8 + 9 setup pass on 2026-11-11 (objective placement and roll-offs, Scout and Ambush steps, map editor objectives removed) and the PR 9B retest the same day (reserve units, objectives without deployment, Fear wording), and the PR 10 Blast split pass the same day; which retired the map builder/editor, terrain structure, elevation picking/LoS, squads, movement & shooting, melee & objectives, and multiplayer/custom-map checks). Earlier retirements: the terrain-structure checklist and the Phase 13.5 combat/squad/ramp/ladder checks. If a later change touches a retired area, add a fresh item here.

**How to use:** tick items as you check them. When a sub-phase changes behaviour, update or add the matching item here (don't create a new per-phase file). When a change alters what a screen, panel or prompt looks like, also re-take its screenshots in the UI inventory (`doc/ux/inventory/index.html`, see `doc/ux/README.md`).

**Setup:** two browser windows (Host and Guest) against the dev server (`npm run dev`) or the deployed build. Press **F9** in game for the LoS/cover debugger (solids cyan, low cover amber, walkable floors purple, climbable floors outlined orange, firing ports green, eye-level ray).

- Verified items removed (owner pass, 2026-11-11): Repel Ambushers, Hold the Line, loadout counts, Blast on the launcher only, two-weapon melee and strike-back, HDF list, squad-mates don't block sight, which model has which weapon. Follow-up from the pass: the per-model weapon list becomes sub-headings in the weapons table (plan PR 1F).
- [ ] **Deadly first (14C-3 PR 1E).** Setup: press F9 in the lobby (developer mode), both players pick "TEST: Loadouts Check", map Standard Battlefield. Deploy everything. Activate your "Test Deadly Squad" (3 models, Tough 3 each: one Fusion Rifle with Deadly(3), two plain Rifles) and move it to within 12" of the enemy's "Test Deadly Squad". Shoot it with both weapons assigned (the two chips are "1× Fusion Rifle" and "2× Rifle"). In the dice panel and unit panel: the Fusion Rifle's unsaved wound kills a whole unhurt model (a model of Tough 3 goes at once), and the Rifles' unsaved wounds then land on the models that are left (one of them hurt but alive), rather than the Rifle wounds wearing down a model the Deadly wound would have finished. Repeat a few times with different dice: whichever weapon is listed first, the Deadly wound is applied first.
